        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="listings">
        <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Ross, and I am a software developer
        and a student. I am 19 years old and in my third year at
        Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Computer Science. I was born and raised in a 
        small town in Texas, which I still call home, even after moving so far away to study. 
        From a young age, I have prided myself in my curiosity and desire to 
        understand how the world works: from computers to 
        mathematics to cooking to music to theater to whatever randomly crosses 
        my mind at 3 AM one night. I'm rarely satisfied by hand-waving and vagueness - I just like
        to dig deeper. When I'm not spending time learning, I 
        enjoy biking, playing the piano, and watching movies/TV.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As a developer, I have mastered the fundamentals of programming
        and computer science while maintaining a healthy dose of learning
        new technologies - including right now as I learn HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 
        to build this website. Through classwork, my internship at Intentional
        Software, and personal endeavors, I have become comfortable 
        programming in variety of languages and styles, with projects
        including a dynamic memory allocator written in C, a
        Game Boy emulator written in Rust, a compiler written in
        OCaml, and many more. I understand the importance of teamwork,
        version control, testing, and design principles that scale. 
        I have developed a particular knack for systems programming,
        and I get excited by the idea of tinkering with compilers, 
        profilers, and operating systems. But most importantly,
        I am always ready to face new challenges and learn new things,
        both on and off the job. I remember back when I was 14, I
        picked up a physics textbook and won a state physics contest
        five months later, and my drive hasn't slowed since then.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you're interested in learning more about my qualifications,
        experience, and projects, take a look around! Feel free to contact
        me about any opportunities you think I may be a good fit for. I 
        am currently searching for a software development internship for
        Summer 2017.
